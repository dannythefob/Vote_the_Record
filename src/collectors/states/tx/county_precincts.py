"""Build a Texas county's precincts.yaml and zips.yaml (and lookup outlines) for one election's ballot.

Usage:
  python src/collectors/states/tx/county_precincts.py --county harris-county --cache <folder> \
      --scotus-sha256 <hash> --ballot-dir data/states/tx/localities/harris-county/elections/2026-11-03 --out <folder>

  Counties are configured in COUNTIES below (precinct layer, district fields, local areas).

  --ballot-dir is only read. Write to a review folder first, then copy the two files into the
  ballot folder (a data/ change, which needs the owner's approval).

Sources (all official, all public):
  - The county's voting precinct layer, with each precinct's commissioner, congressional (plan
    C2333), State House, State Senate, SBOE, and JP/constable districts. Harris: "VPCTs_2026"
    (1,224 precincts). Travis: "Election Precincts" (308 precincts, approved December 4, 2025).
  - U.S. Census Bureau TIGERweb, 2020 ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs), which approximate
    ZIP codes.

precincts.yaml is exact: each precinct's districts come straight from the county layer.
zips.yaml is approximate: both layers are rasterized on a ~110 m grid, and a precinct counts
for a ZIP when it covers at least MIN_SHARE of the ZIP's grid cells inside the county.
When a ZIP's precincts fall in different districts of the same kind, those districts are
written as a nested list ("depends on your address").

Only districts with a contest on the ballot are written (e.g. State Senate districts not up
this year are left out). Everything is written unverified; the owner verifies the sources.
The script refuses to overwrite existing files.
